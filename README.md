# Software Requirements Specification for TransposeX

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Definitions

- **Sheet Music Transposition**: The process of shifting a piece of music from one key to another while maintaining its structure.
- **Optical Music Recognition (OMR)**: A technology that scans and converts printed or handwritten sheet music into a digital format.
- **Functional Requirements**: Features the app must have to meet user needs, such as transposing music and uploading files.
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Constraints on how the app performs, including speed, usability, and security.
- **MusicXML**: A file format that allows digital representation of sheet music for easy editing and sharing.
- **Key Signature**: The set of sharps or flats that defines the tonal center of a piece of music.

### 1.2 Background

Musicians frequently need to transpose sheet music to accommodate different instruments, vocal ranges, or performance needs. However, manual transposition is difficult to learn, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring musicians to rewrite entire scores by hand.

Existing apps like MuseScore and Flat.io allow digital transposition, but they require users to manually input every note, making it impractical for quick adjustments. Our **Sheet Music Key Converter App** aims to fill this gap by allowing users to upload an image or PDF of sheet music and automatically transpose it to any key.

By leveraging **Optical Music Recognition (OMR)** and **music processing algorithms**, the app will provide a seamless solution for music students, accompanists, and hobbyists, making transposition faster, easier, and more accessible to everyone.
